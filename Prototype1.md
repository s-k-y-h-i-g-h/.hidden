My recursive curse subverses
With a hex to the six thousand six - whole universes
Max effect. Mass effect. Gonna need doctors and nurses for hallucinatory check after check 
but I don't checkmate or mate or make many, even at a low rate
I'd rather pound holes in defenses or get mine pounded, whichever way round (it's all love)
Cos my mentality is money orientated and up-rounded 

Hallucinations aren't from real experiences - specifically physical, right? Psych! (Joking)

(Notes are in case you are employees of a state cos I'm not trying to do something wrong like _reason)
My war-fu [war? it's a joke - as in I am joking] will escalate your state of mind (without touching or harming you) till you're high as the sky too [context: my username online is Sky High]
And make me (or you) head of the state (of affairs) cos you find that funny to do, too (and unlike everyone else I don't and aren't bait - I'm here to prevent rage instead of cause it -don't ragequit)
That's an example of getting high, right? Isn't that like an ascent? Just kidding. Already higher (joking) 

(not talking literally) Why can't we all ascend? Is there too little room in the sky among skyscrapers and mountains for us to send everyone? (Joking) 
(I have to clariify in case someone takes it seriously and mistakes a joke for a delusion)
Yes, I know there's too little time, money and high quality things for us all to be kings and queens or whatever

PG tips in my digital page and no triple x, 
condensation high with your weather - wet like sex
at least there's never a drought, right? 
Unless after police there's nothing left cos reports were correct (joking)
Grams of green, white, brown like whenever
That cost more health than I'll pay and NHS can afford to save and how many pronouncements a day?
Buy high? More like buy high fused with subsequent low, with most drugs - and buy gang influence too? Nah.
Unless they only make music in which case the high is the sound - that's sound?
Buy with all that you got? If it's addictive and you're poor then that's right to a dot
Then you lose all the pounds and coppers and notes -- 
and all you got is your roof and your walls and enough boredom to fill 10 times the lot

Explains the weeds and the  - nah, never... 
Something about better depending on whether safer, cheaper, cleaner is approved in how-many-decades after the houses pass legislation giving us the right to go up so we can be high - 2D to 3D to mental health ward   or some shit like that. LOL. Anyway- 

I know every way from here to here and your time is stuck here while you parse this and understand it so this better do more than rhyme with the lines left on the outside of my nose. Joking, for legal reasons. I'm a ghost or whatever and so are you dickheads so go fuck cunts, assholes, someone's ability to talk, temporarily, whatever --

Facts all check in my text and also true the inverse is
Facts: every time I type-flex power disperses


K-PAX reacts on time while states get annexed and I type flex in ncurses
My verses complex is, next, complex verses me but me nothing coerces or forces

Complexes fizz, pop, up on contact in my codex - of me they averse is


Crop up in my eyes, mouth, drop, yup, out my mic, no homo, each converses
They might aswell be talking to coffins in herses cos I perform once every thousand rehearses

You heard this, a thousand times the others - these nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, 
adjectives, preposes, con--- and interjections from this lord caught


and you missed most that and this - true cos this the first time you heard that and the last time you listened to this, bitch
now 
nobody came too late and left too early like an itch, twist.

Yeah, I'm crisp, wish I could type Haskell and Lisp but never type like that on my disp or talk like that with my lips
Dysfunctional, abrasive to many and diamonds and ones, like touching keys on nails leave chips and crossing swords means I killed it


Barely move places, stay first in races - mal-function-al, to some I'm in-valuabal[sp]
Some in value able to see pieces which decide the order of sums - that's invalu-abal[sp]

Some miss what order means to a sum while catching the meaning of order in sums with empty hands cos it's inviable
verbose, obviously the boss, based like I'm made by Bose - who's hungry and toast?


You know where I rest at, it's unspeakable
That I movement detest- that... you're assured to find me sat where I'm registered at, it's unreadable, unadressable, out of bounds like to a cod a vegetable

profit from pressing diamonds on me and rubbing up, down, up - every three - 


till they're polished for free, if you don't count the grains of dust in my pee-pee, cos a bally's only mask on me, figuratively

or do count the grains of diamond in my cock, pay to dock, 


and lose count while I gain queen, only half way and memory's full, page and look slow like a fool 

while I bite myself like I've got teeth on a kite and I'm a tool


or smooth your stones for cost of minimum wage, cos you'd mistake my people for Polish and calm for rage 

if they were free, like pain is, which they aren't in spite of '92 or '93 - or 90-something-whatever


looking at it burns like looking at who? like this diss, like an sti when you piss

tell me how it tastes after I shake it onto the soft and I'll put it on mp3 then take it off 


along with the bulls I see red with when I imagine the dirt and what it's like to give in only one take 

and along with them my own review of being wet if only I didn't spend half my life getting baked or I was dead


never lack of use for traps like me cos I fuck myself or  you for free

and grant wishes so even not feeling the friction turns reactions to instincts to profit not by magic but by apparat


It's apparent that, innit. 4
